Hi,

I'm Jonas Geerdes and I am looking for my first role as a software developer.

I've started my professional journey with PwC, a global accounting and consultancy firm, as an IT consultant. I help companies pass audit! While it's a good job, it disallows creative freedom and work is easily more than the typical 8 - 9 hours in a day. 

Thus, I've tinkered with software development. Can't get too creative with accounting, or I go to jail! Coding and developing projects has become a hobby of mine, one that allows me to disconnect from the world and focus on me and my personal builds. Someday, I'd to launch this creative hobby of mine into a full fledged career where I can review what I've built and shared with clients, collegues, and anything else.

I hope you enjoy what you see, and please reach out to me with any questions about my journey in life! (Or just questions on my profile I'm open to entry level roles.
